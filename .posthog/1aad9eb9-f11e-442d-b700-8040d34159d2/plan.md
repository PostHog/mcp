**Task ID:** 1aad9eb9-f11e-442d-b700-8040d34159d2  
**Generated:** 2025-10-30

## Summary

Append the text "hello 123" to the end of `/Users/jonathan/dev/mcp/README.md`. This is a straightforward file modification task that requires reading the current content and appending the specified text while preserving existing formatting and structure.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Analysis
- [x] Identified target file: `/Users/jonathan/dev/mcp/README.md`
- [x] Confirmed file exists and contains structured markdown documentation
- [x] Verified current ending: MCP Inspector configuration section
- [x] No special formatting or structural considerations required

### 2. Changes Required
- [ ] Read current content of `/Users/jonathan/dev/mcp/README.md`
- [ ] Append "hello 123" to the end of the file
- [ ] Ensure proper line spacing (add newline before appending if needed)

### 3. Implementation
- [ ] Use `mcp__acp__Read` to read the entire README.md file
- [ ] Use `mcp__acp__Edit` to append "hello 123" to the end
- [ ] Verify the change was applied correctly

## File Changes

### New Files
```
None
```

### Modified Files
```
/Users/jonathan/dev/mcp/README.md - Append "hello 123" to the end of the file
```

## Considerations

- **Minimal change**: This is a simple text append operation with no impact on functionality or documentation structure
- **No testing required**: Pure documentation change with no code or behavior modifications
- **No dependencies**: No build scripts, formatters, or validation tools affect README.md content
- **Preservation**: Maintain existing formatting and structure of the README.md file
- **Line spacing**: Ensure appropriate newline character before appending text for clean separation
