I'll analyze the codebase to understand the context and locate the README.md file.```markdown
# Research Findings

## Codebase Analysis
This is a PostHog MCP (Model Context Protocol) server repository with TypeScript and Python implementations. The main README.md file is located at `/Users/jonathan/dev/mcp/README.md` and contains comprehensive documentation about:
- Installation methods (quick install, manual, Docker)
- Usage examples and feature filtering
- Development setup and commands
- Project structure overview

The file is well-structured with clear sections for both users and developers. It ends with MCP Inspector configuration details.

## Key Areas of Focus
- **File to modify**: `/Users/jonathan/dev/mcp/README.md`
- **Action required**: Append "hello 123" to the end of the file
- **Current ending**: The file currently ends with MCP Inspector argument configuration

## Implementation Context
- The project follows clear documentation standards with markdown formatting
- File uses consistent heading hierarchy and code block formatting
- No special formatting or structural considerations needed for appending text
- The file is straightforward markdown with no dynamic content or build processes affecting it
